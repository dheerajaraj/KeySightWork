Document containing steps to download and build u-boot, kernel and rootfs to sdcard. Since U-boot needs to be configured to enable secure boot, the U-boot needs to be built again.
The generation of CSF file, to signing and padding of the u-boot image will also be discussed. Furthermore, a fair bit of the steps outlined online are obsolete. Therefore, we the
problems encountered and the steps to overcome these problems have also been widely discussed. 2 new sections have been added to this process log where it describes how to
configure the u-boot such that it only allows signed kernel images to boot. Also, the test procedures to revoke the SRK, in an event of compromised private keys, have also been 
included in this process log. Enjoy ;)
